## Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews

**Problem Statement:**

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using a logistic regression classification model to predict positive and negative sentiments.

### Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we aim to predict whether IMDB movie reviews are positive or negative based on the text content.

### Libraries and Tools

To carry out this analysis, we utilize various Python libraries and tools, including:

- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- NLTK and spaCy for natural language processing.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
- TextBlob for text processing.

### Dataset

We load the IMDB movie reviews dataset from a publicly available source. The dataset includes text reviews and their corresponding sentiments.

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for analysis, we perform several preprocessing steps:

1. **Text Normalization**: We tokenize the text, remove HTML tags, square brackets, and noisy text.
2. **Remove Special Characters**: Special characters are removed to clean the text further.
3. **Text Stemming**: Text is stemmed to convert words to their base forms.
4. **Remove Stopwords**: Common stopwords are removed from the text data.

### Feature Extraction

We employ two methods for feature extraction:

1. **Bag of Words (BoW) Model**: The CountVectorizer is used to convert text documents into numerical vectors.
2. **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Model**: TF-IDF vectors are created to represent the text data.

### Model Building

We train a logistic regression model using both BoW and TF-IDF features. This model learns to classify reviews as either positive or negative based on the extracted features.

### Model Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using the test dataset. We calculate accuracy scores and generate classification reports to understand how well the model predicts sentiments. Additionally, confusion matrices provide insights into the model's performance.

### Visualizing Reviews

We create word clouds for both positive and negative reviews to visualize common words and phrases associated with each sentiment.

### Conclusion

Sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews using logistic regression provides valuable insights into the sentiments expressed by reviewers. This project showcases the application of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze text data and predict sentiments.
